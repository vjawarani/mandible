# mandible

Mandible is a simple and minimal OSX command line tool written with Python used to remove specific file types from a directory. While unitially developed solely to facilitate the removal of screenshots from the desktop, Mandible now features Presets and a default option. A GUI will likely be coming soon so that presets can be activated from the menu bar rather than a global terminal command. Also, an updated README hopefully.
